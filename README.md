Drawing Graph
Correct implementation of classes.
Check for node overlap.
Check for multigraph (no multiple arcs with the same direction between the same 2 nodes).
Save the adjacency matrix to a file (first line indicates the number of nodes, starting from line 2 the adjacency matrix). Saving should occur after each graph modification.
Ability to choose whether the graph is directed or not (radio button).
If the graph is directed, draw arrows at the vertices. The arrow can be represented by a triangle or drawn with lines (->).
Graph repositioning by dragging nodes with the mouse.
