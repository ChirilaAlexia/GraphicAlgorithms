# GraphicAlgorithms

Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the minimum path between two nodes in a graph (applied to the attached map of Luxemburg)
Draw the map in a window relative to its size (the map resizes with the window, only the edges are graphically represented, not the nodes)
Select 2 nodes (find them by clicking in the window) and display the shortest path between them in a different color.
Finding the nearest node to the clicked location in the window and drawing the found node in a different color
Drawing the shortest path in a different color
